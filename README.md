#  Heart Arrhythmia Detection

Heart arrhythmia detection is a **machine learning project** designed to analyze ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals and detect irregular heartbeats.  
It provides insights into anomalies such as **atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tachycardia,** and more.  
This tool is intended to assist medical professionals in **diagnosing heart conditions with increased accuracy and efficiency**.
